            <h1>lash & skin that comes to you</h1>
            <p>Owners Mallory McIlwain and Melissa Bednarik saw a void in Nashville for a salon where customer service and cleanliness mirrors the expectations of a luxury spa experience.  We believe that getting your nails done should be an enjoyable, relaxing experience where the customer feels completely at ease and relaxed knowing that not only is your service quality a priority, but also the sanitation and your well-being. </p>
